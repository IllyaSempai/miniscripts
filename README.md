This is a times table printer that will accept two inputs for minimum and maximum bounds of a times table
and print the resultant times table to the screen. Optionally you can include pass only one command line 
input to specify and min of 1 and max of the option passed. If no commands are passed the default table
of 1 to 10 is printed. All values are printed in hex.
